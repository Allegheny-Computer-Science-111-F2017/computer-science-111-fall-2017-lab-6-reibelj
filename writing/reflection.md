This lab required me to complete the code for a file called Manipulate DNA.
This was a little difficult for me. It took into account many of the methods
that have been used and combined them all. My biggest problem was just trying
to picture how the system would accomplish the task. For example, in step three
four and five I was required to manipulate the string of DNA. I had to stop and
think of how I was supposed to break up the string and combine the substrings
back in order to remove add or change the string. This was the most challenging
part for me.

Some other problems I ran into included the use of the random Java class. I
tried calling that method in order to choose the random position within the
chosen DNA string. However, it was not imported at the top of the source code
which was caused a little problem. Once that was resolved I was able to move
forward with more ease.

As previously mentioned this lab required calling back a lot of information
from previous labs. Once I was able to realize that I had to make use of these
methods I was able to start making progress. Overall, it was a difficult lab
because I had to think outside of the source code so to speak. Once I saw how
the strings needed to be changed I was able to use the methods learned in order
to correctly achieve the goal and complete the assignment.
